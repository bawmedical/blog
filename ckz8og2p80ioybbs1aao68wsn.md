## Everything Is Awesome! in Health IT

[**TL;DR:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) Everything is not Awesome.

If you were at the recent [EHI Live digital health conference/trade-show](http://ehilive.co.uk/), you’d be forgiven for thinking that we are poised at an **unique point in medical history** — within a few years every single disease and affliction will be eradicated by the simple application of the proprietary technology they’re selling, and we as a human race will ascend to the stars on a pillar of unicorn-flavoured glitter.

**Everything Is Awesome! Yay!**

You look around — every enormous glowing stand exhibits great tech that **just works**.

There are keynote talks about the brightness of the future, earnest admission of (but crucially not *accountability for*) the past mistakes of NHS IT, and all-round blind optimism.

There is much lauding of **#blockchain** and **#bigdata**, even though we haven’t really worked out how (if at all) they will be intelligently, safely and ethically applied to medicine and the NHS.

The tech is in fact so **Awesome**, and so perfected, that many stands just have gimmicks (games, massage chairs, freebies) instead of showing the tech — so much so that if you ask to **see** and **test-drive** any of the software, many stand-holders are frankly agape.

As an aside, every one of those stands costs tens of thousands of pounds, by the way, and — eventually — pretty much *all of that cost comes back to the NHS —* in the form of higher prices on systems.

*(actually, I noticed there was little or no real innovation to be seen, only mashups and remixes of the* [*Clinical 5*](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_086127.pdf) *being sold at the same or higher price than 10 years ago — but that’s* ***another story for another blog post****)*

### There’s a gaping chasm between this glitzy, high budget world of tech and the **dystopian reality** of working with tech in a real NHS setting. It also seems there aren’t many people in Health IT talking about this gap.

The ‘Everything Is Awesome’ version

#### **The ‘Everything Is Awesome’ version: All NHS staff have an NHS Smart Card and the problem of staff identity and roles is solved.**

#### **The Reality: Access to smart cards can take weeks, and workarounds are used that could make ID’ing the staff member responsible for a particular action difficult or impossible.**

Woefully inadequate funding of front-line IT support, and a frankly **unbelievable** disconnect between HR and IT teams, means that [NHS Smart Cards](http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/rasmartcards) (which are required to access critical NHS services, and without which it’s pretty hard to do *anything* in some settings) can take **weeks** to be provided to new or itinerant staff, and in the meantime *you’re still expected to be clinically effective*.

**Patient care is our priority, so people find workarounds**: they do all those things we are *explicitly told we must not do* — sharing smart cards, leaving cards in computers for the whole team to use, all sorts of ugly shenanigans that we know we shouldn’t do but **we sometimes have to do in order to carry on carrying on.**

As a locum doctor, although I have my **own** NHS Smart Card, I am often asked to use one of a stack of ‘Locum Smart Cards’, because these are already set up to have access at that care organisation. There is sometimes a cursory attempt to record my name and the times I was using that card for. But we all know the likelihood of being able to work out who was using a particular card at a particular time is pretty thin. It doesn’t feel exactly robust, and it ain’t Awesome.

Some reality

#### The ‘Everything Is Awesome’ version: **Paperless by 2020 (or is it 2023 now?) obviously makes everything better.**

#### The Reality: In many places this will probably be achieved by just scanning paper records, creating an impenetrable, unsearchable ‘dark’ clinical record. Obviously everything is worse.

I *know* of at least one trust where the community nurses have **utterly broken recordkeeping** — they have a full GP clinical system at their disposal, installed at the trust at considerable expense and allowing the trust to claim they are #’digital’, but the community nurses in some areas are **only allowed to use it for collecting managerial data**, and then have to duplicate everything into the paper records they *actually* use for clinical care.

At some point the trust will run out of time to be #paperless and so, in a panic, someone will get all the clinical records digitally scanned. Awesome! Except the problem is that these records are now locked in clunky, unbrowseable, unsearchable [EDMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) systems. **This is the ‘dark’ clinical record. Like ‘dark’ matter and ‘dark’ energy you know it’s there, but you can’t find it.**

### If we don’t talk about it, we can’t fix it

This isn’t a rant about EHI Live itself. There are a dozen other similar events across the year, all the same. The same glib Everything Is Awesome atmosphere, the same hollow emptiness I feel when I think about the reality.

There’s so many more examples I could give, but you get the picture. Let’s start talking about it.
